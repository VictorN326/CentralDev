Link to application: https://centraldev.vercel.app/


CentralDev is an application for developers to ask and answer development-related questions to a wide range of communities. This allows for the community to interact with the questions by answering the question, upvoting/downvoting questions and answers, and even using a generate an AI answer functionality to use AI to answer so that the user can review and edit so that they can quickly help users get their question answered. The more the users interact and use the application, they will start to earn badges that are displayed on their profile to recognize their contribution to the platform (it does take a lot of work and commitment). With each account created, a profile is created that users can edit and view themselves to display what they want the community to see of them. 


The application is made with TypeScript, Next.JS/React, Zod, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, and Zod.
